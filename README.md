ReadMe
Currently just a random *gig* selector.
Run selector.py (tested with Python 3.7.0)
Requires a file called "gigs.csv" based off've the template.csv
Dates should be dd/mm/yyyy and prices currently removes Â£ symbols only, so for other curremcies just don't bother with the symbol, or edit it as you need.

random.py is not a module, rather it is a playground to trial bits of code outside of the main selector.py.
